# Event Management Application
## About the Application
The application is a web based simple multi-user real-time Social Event Management System build using Flask.
This System allows the user to sign up using email or phone number. A user can also create, edit and delete the event created by him/her. 
He/She can also search from the list of existing events. Whenever any user creates an event, the rest of the user gets notified via email and the recently created events appear on the top of the event list along with the name of the user name whom the event has been created and the date on which the event is posted.
